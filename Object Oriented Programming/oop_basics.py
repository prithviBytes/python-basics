# What is OOP?
# Object oriented programming is a style of programming in which
# we try to model some process or thing in the real world using
# classes and objects.

# What is a class?
# Its is a blueprint for objects. Classes can contain methods(functions)
# and attributes.

# What is an instance?
# Objects that are constructed using the class blueprint, that contains the
# class methods and properties.

# Why OOP?
# With OOP the goal is to encapsulate your code into logical, hierarchical,
# groupings using class so that you can reason about your code in a higher level.
# PS: Its not necessary.

# What is Encapsulation?
# Grouping of public and private attributes and methods making abstraction possible.
# Example: DECK OF CARD: The cards can be private. But we might need the length of the cards
# so for that we will create a public method which can then be access outside.

# What is Abstraction?
# Abstraction is exposing only relevant data in the class interface, hiding private attributes
# and methods (inner workings) from the user.
