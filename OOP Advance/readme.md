### Polymorphism
An object can take many forms
2 Types:
- Same method works in similar way for different class.
- Same operation works on different kinds of classes.

```
8 + 2  #10 
"8" + "2" #"82"
```

+ operator is shorthand for __add__() that gets called on the first operand.
__add__() is defined both on int and str.
If the first operand is a string then it concats the strings or if its a int it does mathematical addition.
